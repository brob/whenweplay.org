# A quick statement of purpose for When We Play

When we play, something magical happens. We come unbound, if only for a time, from the mundane pace of our small reality, and connect to something greater. If we don’t take the time to play, we’re only ever what, who, and where we are.

**We can be something greater.**

When We Play, as an orginization, is dedicated to the belief that Play is important for everyone. Play is for children. Play is for teenagers. Play is for adults.

Beyond that, Play is for families, for communities, for businesses, and maybe for the world.

## What When We Play will focus on

While we could focus on many aspects of play (talking to businesses, getting adults back into play, etc.), our current plan is to focus on the fact that family bonds can strengthen through shared play. We want to help families learn to play together.

As children enter the world, their adult caretakers inherently play with them. It's a natural reaction that stems back to our oldest ancestors. It's how we learn language, it's how we learn motor skills, it's how we learn to be human. As our children get older, we phase out of a shared state of play, and that's a shame. Making room in our schedules and lives to play together as a family will strengthen bonds through deeper communication, connection, and interests.

We're not yet sure all that this means. We'll start with some blog posts, and maybe some small aids to help families get in the habit. If you have any ideas, we'd love to hear them.
