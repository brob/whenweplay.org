# Play expands the soul

When my soul stifles, the remedy *must* be play.

My soul must breathe. I must take in experiences which nourish it. I must expel the waste my survival has necessitated.

A lack of nutrients will stifle the growth of my soul. New perspectives, new puzzles, new creations will give my soul ingredients to create my next idea, my next step, or my next balm. A buildup of worry, of cynicism, of “mere survival” will sap the beauty from my life. Catharsis, joy, silliness will flush these toxins from my system.

Every day requires some new expression, which is why it’s fantastic that there is no single form of play.

**When my existence has been sedintary**, a mere walk in the woods can spark the divine. 

**When the Sisyphusian tasks build in my every day life**, the application of a well-kneaded, well-developed dough can calm the rushed and bustled to-do lists. 

**When the mundane seems to press in from all angles**, journeying through the well-worn paths of The Shire, the hyperspace lanes of a galaxy far, far away, or into and out of the Good or Bad Place will anchor me more closely to where I need to be. 

**When my mind feels more like a prison than an endless canvas**, taking up arms as a gnome dedicated to protecting my friends and kin reminds me that there are as many perspectives as there are individuals in this world.

**When my work feels unrewarding**, the well-laid bishop feint, the strategically moved meeple, or the triumph of a come-from-behind strategy will remind me that each victory is important no matter the size.

Games, stories, creativity will revive and expand my soul in new and amazing ways each time I play.

**Play more; live more.**
