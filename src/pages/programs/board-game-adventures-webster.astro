        <p>
            When we play together, we learn to connect more. Board games serve as a community experience that helps kids learn to interact with one another in more meaningful ways. At the same time, games help teach critical thinking, resiliency, and strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this program, we take students on a journey through a variety of game mechanics they may have never seen before. From deck-building to worker placement to push-your-luck games, each week weâ€™ll explore a different mechanic, play games, and talk about how it all comes together, in a meaningful, connective, screen-free way.        
        </p>
